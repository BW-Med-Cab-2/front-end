Hey Reese! So just adding this text file in to give you an idea of the things we had to change,
(and I will also talk about the things that we still need to change, but that I'm not sure the intricacies)
which again we will gladly chat about in a call this evening when you have time:

*First Change*
We updated the axiosWithAuth function.

export const axiosWithAuth = () => {
  const token = window.localStorage.getItem('token');
  return Axios.create({
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Basic ${btoa('lambda-client:lambda-secret')}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
    },

    baseURL:'https://medcab2.herokuapp.com/'
  });
}

I'm not certain on the exact reason, perhaps Caleb can explain more, however, the only change is 
that we had to insert the headers from your actions/index.js into here.


*Second Change*
We need a separate axios auth function to handle the signup.

export const axiosRegister = () => {
    //get token
    const token = window.localStorage.getItem('token');
  
    //create new Instance
    return Axios.create({
      headers: {
        authorization: token
      },
  
      baseURL:'https://medcab2.herokuapp.com/'
    });
  }
  
This might seem counterproductive because this is exactly how you had it built
in the first place, but because the headers we're submitting are different, we needed 
different setups. Again, Caleb understands more about it than I do. XD


*Third Change*
We've gotten the submit handler working for the questionnaire!

!!NOTE:!!
This change is updated on the master branch, but I still feel you should be aware of it.
This one honestly gave us the most issue, but we managed to get things figured out by
restructuring how it was built and using Headers and stuff. HOWEVER, we're getting a response, 
we aren't erroring at least, but the submit handler will still need some work.


Which leads to 

*To Do 1:*

Response from submit handler on Questions.js will need to be updated.
Currently, the response from the get request is just being console logged; 
our .then() will need to be reworked to redirect the user to the dashboard, 
and to set the data you need from res into state on the dashboard.
(Unsure of the updated path or how to access the dashboard) 


Besides updating this submit handler, and building out the dashboard, 
making sure the login page redirects(it wasn't on my end, but you've been 
working on stuff, so not sure if something had changed), and making sure the
registration page redirects to the login page upon submit, I think that's it
for the things we need to be fully functioning!
